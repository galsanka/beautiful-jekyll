title: About me
---

My name is Georges Eli Alsankary. I am a graduate student in Texas A&M's Electrical and Computer Engineering department. I graduated from Notre Dame in 2020 with a BS in Computer Engineering.

I have interests in broader computer engineering topics like computer architecture and embedded systems. I have yet to choose an area of specialization, but I love working in hardware-software codesign. More specifically, I'm interested optimizing hardware for scientific computing. I also believe that teaching is a big component of graduate education, and have secondary interests in engineering education
