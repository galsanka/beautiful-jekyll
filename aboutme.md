---

My name is Georges Alsankary. I am a graduate student in Computer Enigneering at Texas A&M. I graduated from Notre Dame in 2020 with a BS in Computer Engineering.

I have interests in broader computer engineering topics like computer architecture and embedded syste,s. I haven't chosen an area of specialization, but I love working in hardware-software codesign. Specifically, a big interest of mine would be optimizing hardware for scientific computing.
